## What is programming

* A list of pre-configured choices;
* given some data;
* logic is applied;
* new data might get generated;
* new data becomes input for other choices;
* the cycle keeps repeating;
* inputs and outputs generated until the program terminates.

## More about data

* Data is presented in certain ways
* Programs use the right data
* When the data is 'right' programs do certain things.

## What programs do

* They remember things
* Make choices on what work to do
* Do some work
* Do work until a condition is met
* What programs need to remember becomes more complicated:
    * attributes might need to be grouped together
    * more things might need to be structured better

## Functions

Functions are a way:
* of stop repeating yourself
* to give a piece of code a name
* to reuse logic
