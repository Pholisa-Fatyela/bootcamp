# Variables

Data is one of the fundamental building blocks when programming. Programs store data about a wide array of topics. And can be various different types - the basic types includes numbers, strings or boolean data. Or more complicated data such as collections of data called Arrays. Or key value pairs where by a key can be associated with a value - which can ultimate be used to model Objects. Objects are more complicated variables that contains a collection of attributes about a real world object.

Data in a program is stored in variables, variables can change over time. Programs can control lots of different variables that store lot of different information.

## Creating variables

Programs store information in variables which needs to be defined before they can be used. Defining a variable is `allocating space` where data can be stored. If one try to use a variable before it is defined it could lead to problems - it can lead to `not defined` errors. This mean that the variable can't be used yet. Once a variable is defined, but it doesn't have a value yet it is `undefined` - and still can't be used.


## Try it out:

Open a new `terminal` window:

* type `node` to start NodeJS or the Chrome Web Console
* Now try and access a variable called `firstName` - what happens?
* Now define the variable `var firstName;` - try to access it? What happens?
* Now give it a value = `var firstName = 'Andr√©';` What happened?

When you are trying to use a variable that doesn't exists programs are normally not happy. Watch our for that!

## Using variables

Using variables are very useful as they contains information that you can use. You can use them as the source for new variables or you can combine them with conditional statements to make decisions. More about that soon.

## You can use variables to:

    * create new variables
    * make decisions about them
