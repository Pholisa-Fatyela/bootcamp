# Choices about variables

You now know how to create and access variables now let's look into how to make decisions using variables. Conditional statements allows a program to make choices based on the values of variables. Combining variables, logical operators and values program flow can be controlled. This is called the program control flow.

Examples of logical operators includes equals (`===`), less than (`<`), greater than (`>`), greater or equal than (`>=`) and less or equal than (`<=`). Logical operators can be combined using and (`&&`) and or (`||`) operators. That we one can check if multiple conditions or sub conditions are met.

## Applied choices

Let's look at a promotion that our cellphone provider is running:

`Phone calls costs 7 cents per second unless a phone call is longer than 30 seconds then it costs 4 cents per second.`

How would this affect the code you created so far? What would you need to do to add to your code to support this promotion?

Write functions that can answers these questions:

* Do a call qualify for discount?
* How many calls qualify for discount?
* What is the discounted price for a call?
* What is the original price for a call?

Given a list of call durations, write functions that answer these questions:

* total price for all the calls including the discount?
* what is the total value of the discount?
