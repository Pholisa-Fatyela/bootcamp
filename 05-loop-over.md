# Loop over variables

Using Lists any Arrays makes it easier to use more variables together. And by using loops you can use less code to access variables in Lists & Arrays.

There are various different loop types.

Loops are doing the same things over until a certain condition is met or not yet met.

What different kind of loops have you came across?

Two basic types are:

* `For` loops works well if you have a list and you would like to visit each entry in the list

* `While` loops works well to keep on doing something until a certain condition is met.

## Loop constructs

To loop over a List you need to access to be able to increment a variable and then use a conditional statements to check if the variable is still with in bounds and not bigger than the list is long.
