---

Using Lists any Arrays makes it easier to use more variables together. And by using loops you can use less code to access variables in Lists & Arrays.

There are various different loop types.

Loops are doing the same things over until a certain condition is met or not yet met.

What different kind of loops have you came across?

* `For` loops works well if you have a list and you would like to visit each entry in the list

* `While` loops works well to keep on doing something until a certain condition is met.
