# Variables on web pages

> This is a idea of how to introduce people to accessing data on a web page using the DOM (the document variable). This is a seed for a discussion of a very user-friendly nature. This text should be very approachable to help coders to complete these exercises: [Number check](http://output.jsbin.com/zuvagid) and the [Budget tracket](http://output.jsbin.com/fisegeh) - the idea being that they use the basics about variables, loops, conditional statements and functions in a new 'still approachable' context that stretch them a bit.

Web pages in the browser expose the `Document Object Model` (DOM), the internal structure of a web page in a variable called `document`. The document variable can be accessed from Javascript in a web page. The `document` variable can be used to do things (tell us things about...) with web pages.

Amongst other things it can be used:

* to get hold of elements on a page;
* elements can be used to get values entered into elements on a web page;
* manage the classNames attached to web page elements;
* register actions that should happen when inter acting with elements, such as clicking on button, link or typing in data.
