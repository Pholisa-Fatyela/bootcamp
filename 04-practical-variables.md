## Practical variables

Now that you know more about variables let's get more practical. Cellphones are a part of your daily lives. And know who and for how long people phoned us is important.

We will focus on the how long part. Let's say we know the information about the last four phone calls you received.

The last 4 calls you received was `23, 47, 50 and 17` seconds long each.

`var costPerSecond = 7`;

Now using variables calculate the following:

* the total duration of all 4 last calls;
* the total cost for each call;
* the total cost for all calls.

## List them

Instead of defining individual variables each for each duration, creating a list that contains the 4 call durations is easier:

> TODO : `talk about Arrays & Lists`

`
var callDurations = [23, 47, 50, 17];
`

> Do you still remember how to access values in a list?

Now use the `callDurations` List variable to calculate the following:

* the total duration of all 4 last calls;
* the total cost for each call;
* the total cost for all calls.

Remember to use indexes to access data.
