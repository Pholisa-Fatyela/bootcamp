# Functions introduction - practicals

Do the practical exercises below. Create each function in it's own file, use the function name for the filename.


Do all this work under your projects folder in a folder called `function_intro`. Commit this folder and it contents to github.

## Strings:

Write a function called `greet` that takes your neighbourâ€™s name as a parameter and prints a greeting to them.

## String & Lists

Write a function called `countRegNumber` that takes in a string parameter that looks like this `CA 182736,CY 523519,CJ 812328` and returns the number of registration numbers in the string. It should also work for this string `CA 42665, AA 12 RT GP`. Test it with some strings of your own. Use Strings builtin `split` function. And List objects `length` function.

## Dates

Write a function that returns a boolean to find out if today is Tuesday called `isTuesday`?

## Vehicle registration numbers

Using Javascript strings built in `startsWith` and `endsWith` to write functions that identify the origin of vehicle registration numbers.

| Function name | Description     |
| :-------------  | :------------- |
| isFromBellville | returns true if a registration number is for Bellville otherwise returns false if not. A registration number for Bellville starts with `CY`       |
| isFromPaarl | returns true if a registration number is for Paarl otherwise returns false. Paarl registration numbers starts with `CJ`      |
| isFromCapeTown | returns true if a registration number is for Cape Town otherwise returns false. Cape Town registration looks like this `CA 732-127`      |
| isFromGauteng | returns true if a registration number is for Gauteng otherwise returns false. Gauteng registration numbers looks like this `DR 12 TY GP`|
| isFromLimpopo | returns true if a registration number is for Limpopo otherwise returns false. Limpopo registration numbers looks like this `DRT 122 L`|

## More general registration number functions

Write a function called `myRegChecks` that can check if a registration number is for GP, L, EC, MP. The function takes two parameters, first the registration number and then the letter/s registration number ends with. Returns true/false. Create a version of the functio for Kwazulu Natal & the Western Cape as well. Call is `capeKznRegChecks`.

```javascript

var isGP = myRegChecks('DV 23 NB GP', 'GP');

//should print true
console.log(isGP);

var isMP = myRegChecks('DV 23 LP GP', 'MP');

//should print false
console.log(isMP);

// should return true
var isCY = capeKznRegChecks('CY189-012', 'CY');

//should return false
var isND = capeKznRegChecks('CY189-012', 'ND');
```

## Dates:

Using the Javascript Date object to write the functions below.


This code contains some of the building logic you need for the functions

```javascript

const date = new Date('2010-04-01');
var weekDays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Saturday'];

//return index between 0 and 6
console.log(date.getDay());

//look up the week day text string from the Array
console.log(weekDays[date.getDay()]);
```

Write a function called `isWeekday` find out if the parameter passed in is a weekDay.

Write a function called `yearsAgo` that takes in a `year` and return how many years ago that was. Use the Date objects `getFullYear` function.

Write a function called `dayToday` to find the day today. This function takes no parameters;

Write a function called `getDay` which can find out which day of the week a specific date was.

Write a function called `sameWeekday` that takes in two dates and check if both dates have the same weekday. For example if both dates are a Monday the function should return true.
