# Using the terminal

Let’s try it! Open a terminal window.

## Find out where you are and what is there

* type `pwd` then press enter. What does it do?
* type `ls` then press enter. What does it do?
* type `ls -alt` then press enter. What does that do?

## Creating & navigating folders

* type `mkdir projects` then press enter - what does it do?
* type `ls` then press enter - what does it do?
* type `cd projects` then press enter
* now try `pwd` & `ls` again

## Creating files & opening programs

One can use the `touch` command to create a new text file and also open a text editor from the command line.

* create a new file called `my_file.txt`
* type `touch my_file.txt`
* edit the file using a text editor called `atom`
* to open your exercise folder in atom type `atom .` and press enter in the terminal.

## More command line practice:

From the command line:

* Create a new folder called `planning`
* Change into it
* Create a new file called `my_plans.txt` in the `planning` folder
* Edit the file in `atom`, and add the items:
    * learn to use the terminal
    * learn git
    * add anything else you would like to achieve?

* Save all the commands you learnt so far in a file called ‘commands.txt’.
