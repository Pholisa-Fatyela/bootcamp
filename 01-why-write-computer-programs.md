# Why do we write computer programs?

To get things done.
To get things done fast.
To get things done reliably.

Humans gets tired of doing the same thing over and over.
Humans get bored.
Humans makes mistakes when they get tired.

Computers not.

Computer programs allow people to tell computers what to do.
Computers then start and do things as requested by humans.

> `What is programming not?` It's not a guess. Or a list of guesses.

## Programming languages

Humans use programming language to tell computers what to do. Programming languages are like any language with some built in commands that can be used to achieve things.

## Lots of languages

As there are lots of different languages that people speak, there are lots of different programming languages. Each programming language also have it's own speakers and 'culture'.

## Fullstack Javascript

You will be focussing on Javascript traditionally the language of the internet. Javascript started out is a language that can be used to programming web pages. But it grew into a language that can also be used to program databases and server side components.

So it allows you to do 'fullstack' programming - 'fullstack' meaning all the part of the of a web application. Both the front-end - the screens and the back-end as in how and where data is saved.

## Using Javascript

Javascript the language have some built in functions and functionality that you can use. And it also allow you to create your own functionality to solve your problems.

### Built-in functionality

> Look on the [MDN site for what Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) can do.


```javascript
    // print a message to the console
    console.log('This is a message from Javascript');
```

The [Math object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) got some built is Math functionality.


```javascript

    //get the current date
    var currentDate = new Date();
    console.log(currentDate);

    //get the current year
    console.log(currentDate.getFullYear());

    //get the currentMonth
    console.log(currentDate.getMonth());

```
